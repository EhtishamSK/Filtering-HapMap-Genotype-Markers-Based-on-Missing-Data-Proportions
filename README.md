This R script filters markers in a HapMap genotype dataset based on missing data proportions. It reads the HapMap file, replaces missing data placeholders (NA, -, or NN) with NA, calculates the proportion of missing data for each marker, and retains markers below a specified threshold (default: 10%). The filtered dataset is saved as a new file, and a summary of the total, removed, and retained markers is displayed for downstream analysis.
